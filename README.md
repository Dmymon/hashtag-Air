# hashtag-Air
A 3D multiplayer for academic research purposes which test cooperation and incivility acts performed by players. the game built with Unity and written in C#. I used Unet component for the communication layer. its my first creation with Unity so the graphics is little primitive (and mind the fact i havent got any design skills :-p ). The game's main target is to keep your air tank filled with oxygen and try to make it to the rescue room. in order to get to the rescue room the players must cooperate in the form of using their mechanic arms to stream power to the gate sockets which then opens the gate for the players to continue to the next room. player whoes air runs out is eliminated which makes it hard for gathering the suficient amount of players for opening the stage gates so it is important to keep as many players alive, one way to do that is by dragging a player and the more helpful way is to stream oxygen to a player when dragging him. all of that actions can happen when a player asks those action from the other players by using the chat menu. the players who gets to the rescue room are the winners!!
